description: "Mum and Baby fitness classes designed to build strength and
  stamina after giving birth. Bring your babies with you to the classes so you
  do not need to find childcare. I offer adaptations and advice for common
  conditions such as pelvic floor dysfunction and Diastasis Recti. I
  am  postnatal exercise and wellness specialist and have designed classes to
  safely get you back into exercise. You will be pre screened via a
  questionnaire before you attend the class and I am very willing to offer
  individual help to those that need it. "
