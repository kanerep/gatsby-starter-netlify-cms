description: Mum and Baby Fitness Classes designed to build strength and stamina
  after giving birth. Bring your babies with you to the classes so you do not
  need to find childcare. I offer adaptations and advice for common conditions
  such as Pelvic Floor Dysfunction and Diastasis Recti. I am a Postnatal
  Exercise and Wellness Specialist and have designed classes to safely get you
  back into exercise. You will be pre screened via a questionnaire before you
  attend the class and I am very willing to offer individual help to those that
  need it. As well as this, I work closely with a Women's Health Physio and
  C-Section Scar Massage Therapist, so can refer you as and when is needed.

        A 45 minute class designed to strengthen and build stamina. The sessions
        are different each week switching from a circuit training style class
        with weights to a lead aerobics style class using resistance bands and
        bodyweight exercises. These classes are run on Tuesday mornings
        11:00-11:45 at The Wycliffe Rooms in Lutterworth and Thursday mornings
        10:30-11:15 at the Blaby and Whetstone Boys Club in Whetstone.

      text: If you feel you need a more individualised fitness plan or extra help
        after your pregnancy, then I offer personal training sessions in the
        comfort of your own homes. I bring all the equipment to you so again,
        there is no need to find childcare or even leave the house!

testimonials:
  - author: "Chloe Stevenson "
    quote: I've never stuck to workout classes or kept to regular exercise, but I
      love your classes! I've seen such good results; I thought I was never
      going to be able to wear anything tight again until I started your
      classes.
  - author: "Emma Robinson "
    quote: I am really enjoying the 1-1 sessions! I ache so much after the sessions
      but I'm already starting to feel stronger.
