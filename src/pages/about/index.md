### I’m **Sam** the owner of **SLC Fitness**!

I have always had a huge passion for health and fitness. Before I started my own fitness business, I was a professional dancer and spent years training and travelling the world performing. Taking care of my body and staying fit and healthy in order to perform consistently night after night was crucial.

However, with the dance industry comes a very specific way your body needs to be and look, which can take a toll on your mental health. This inspired me to create **SLC Fitness**; a business that not only supports the physical aspects that fitness can give you, such as weight loss and toning, but also to be the kind of instructor that promotes positive body image and supports mental health.

**SLC Fitness** first started in a very tragic time for me. I was previously in Australia where I got offered a year long dance contract. However I received the the worst news of my life; my mum had been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and was given 6 months - 1 year to live. My whole world turned upside down and I had to leave my dance career behind and fly back to the UK to be by my mum's side.

It was in amongst the turmoil of home that I decided I needed to do something for myself to help me cope. For me, that thing was fitness! I decided to build classes and create an atmosphere where other people could switch off and escape for 45 minutes alongside myself. My fitness classes allowed me and everyone attending to focus on ourselves and have a laugh whilst working hard.

I sadly lost my mum only 4 months after creating my business. I can honestly say I wouldn’t have got through all of this without my classes and exercising.

This life changing and traumatic experience displayed to me the power of exercise and its huge benefits for mental and physical well-being. It's incredible how much exercise can change your whole mindset whilst also helping you to achieve your fitness goals.

Whether it be general weight loss, toning or just to be active and socialise, I'm here to help you on your fitness journey and make you feel fabulous!

### Qualifications

I am a professionally trained dancer, Level 2 Fitness Instructor, Level 3 Pre and Postnatal Exercise, an Advanced Postnatal Exercise and Wellness Practitioner, Advanced Pregnancy exercise and wellness practitioner,  Level 2 Gym instructor and Level 3 personal trainer. As well as this, I have obtained a Certificate in Nutrition awarded by Optimum Nutrition. I absolutely love teaching all my classes but I felt that the postnatal client is very neglected when it comes to help with recovery and getting back into exercise safely. This lack of representation and services for the postnatal client is what lead me to become specialised in this field.
