### About me 

Hi everyone i'm Sam the owner of SLC FITNESS! 

I have always had a huge passion for health and fitness. Before i started my own fitness business, i was a professional dancer and spent years training and travelling the world performing. Taking care of my body and staying fit and healthy to do the shows was so important. 

However, with the dance industry comes a very specific way your body needs to be and look,which can take a toll on your mental health. this inspired me to one day create a fitness business that not only supported the physical aspects that fitness can give you such as weight loss and toning, but i wanted to be the kind of instructor that promotes positive body image and supports mental health. 

Fitness personally helped me through a very difficult time in my life which was loosing my mum. Fitness helped me to be able to cope and get through such a tragic time. So i decided to build classes and create an atmosphere where other people could switch off and escape for 45 minutes. My fitness classes have allowed me and everyone else to focus on ourselves and have a laugh whilst working hard. 

### Qualifications 

I am a professionally trained dancer, Level 2 fitness instructor, Level 3 Pre and Postnatal exercise and an advanced postnatal exercise and wellness practitioner.
