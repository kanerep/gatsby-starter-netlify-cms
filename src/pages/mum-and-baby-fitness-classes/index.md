description: Mum and Baby Fitness Classes designed to build strength and stamina
  after giving birth. Bring your babies with you to the classes so you do not
  need to find childcare. I offer adaptations and advice for common conditions
  such as Pelvic Floor Dysfunction and Diastasis Recti. I am a Postnatal
  Exercise and Wellness Specialist and have designed classes to safely get you
  back into exercise. You will be pre screened via a questionnaire before you
  attend the class and I am very willing to offer individual help to those that
  need it. As well as this, I work closely with a Women's Health Physio and
  C-Section Scar Massage Therapist, so can refer you as and when is needed.

      text: "If you feel you need a more individualised fitness plan or extra help
        after your pregnancy or during your pregnancy, then I offer personal
        training sessions in the comfort of your own homes or location of your
        choice. I bring all the equipment to you so again, there is no need to
        find childcare or even leave the house! I also offer 2-1 personal
        training if you also want to do your sessions with a friend. I offer
        training plans, accountability and help and guidance with nutrition. "

testimonials:
  - author: "Chloe Stevenson "
    quote: I've never stuck to workout classes or kept to regular exercise, but I
      love your classes! I've seen such good results; I thought I was never
      going to be able to wear anything tight again until I started your
      classes.

    quote: "Mum and baby class with SLC Fitness was fab. Never smiled so much
      throughout a workout that's made me sweat so much! Max loved the music and
      watching mummy jump around. "
